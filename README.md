<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This project takes data from the Cleveland heart disease dataset, [available on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/ronitf/heart-disease-uci). This dataset includes data on sex, age, commonly used health metrics, and more, as well as a column for cardiovascular disease status. 

There are 2 exploratory questions answered and one prediction model built in this project. 

<!-- BUILT WITH -->
### Built With

* Jupyter Notebooks
* Pandas/Numpy
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
* Scikit

<!-- QUESTIONS -->
## Driving Questions

1. What factors are most impacted by patient gender?
2. Is there a difference in symptoms for patients in different age groups?
3. What factors best predict heart disease risk?

<!-- FINDINGS -->
## Findings

Through this project, we were able to answer our three driving questions.

* More females than males in this dataset have heart disease. Men with heart disease tend to be older and have positively-skewed serum cholesterol levels while females tend to have higher maximum heart rates.
* Younger patients tend to have lower serum cholesterol and higher maximum heart rates. Age seems to not have an impact on resting blood pressure, likely because this already has such a small range.
* The best factors to predict heart disease risk are thalassemia, the number of blood vessels determined by flourosopy and the maximum heart rate. EKG st slope and resting pressure are not good predictors. All other factors are slight predictors.
