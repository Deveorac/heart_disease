<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This project takes data from the Cleveland heart disease dataset, [available on Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/ronitf/heart-disease-uci). This dataset includes data on sex, age, commonly used health metrics, and more, as well as a column for cardiovascular disease status. 

There are 2 exploratory questions answered and one prediction model built in this project.

<!-- FINDINGS -->
## Findings

Through the analysis, some interesting observations were made:

* There is increased usage in March, April, July, and October.
* The vast majority of trips are less than 10 minute long.
* Most of the bikes are used for commutes, as demonstrated by the peaks in usage around 8-9 AM and 5-6 PM.
  * Customers, who likely are not using the bikes for commutes, typically have longer rides.
* The time of day when a bike is rented has no impact on how long the trip will be.
  * However, any true effect of time of day may be hidden by the overwhelming number of trips less than 10 minutes in duration.
* In the customer use by time of day graph, we see that some customers may be using the bikes for a one-off commute, or to test the service for a commute before becoming a subscriber.
