<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This project started by gathering data from the Ford GoBike website (now under Lyft) for all months of 2019. Data was aggregated and cleaned. A series of visualizations (univariate, bivariate, and multivariate) were created to explore the data.  

### Built With

* Jupyter Notebooks
* Pandas/Numpy
* Matplotlib
* Seaborn
* Geopandas


<!-- SKILLS -->
## Skills

Data was gathered from an open online database, aggregated, and cursory cleaning was performed. New columns for day and month were created from the existing timecode column. 

Most of this project revolved around visualizations for univariate, bivariate, and multivariate questions. 

<!-- SUMMARY -->
## Summary

In this project, key information about GoBike/BayWheels usage was explored, including information about what time of the day and week different users are more likely to use the bikes. 

<!-- FINDINGS -->
## Key Insights

Through the analysis, some interesting observations were made:

* There is increased usage in March, April, July, and October.
* The vast majority of trips are less than 10 minute long.
* Most of the bikes are used for commutes, as demonstrated by the peaks in usage around 8-9 AM and 5-6 PM.
  * Customers, who likely are not using the bikes for commutes, typically have longer rides.
* The time of day when a bike is rented has no impact on how long the trip will be.
  * However, any true effect of time of day may be hidden by the overwhelming number of trips less than 10 minutes in duration.
* In the customer use by time of day graph, we see that some customers may be using the bikes for a one-off commute, or to test the service for a commute before becoming a subscriber.
